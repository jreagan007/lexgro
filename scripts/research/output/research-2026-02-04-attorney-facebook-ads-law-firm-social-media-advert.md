Your Facebook ads are probably underperforming. Here's why.

Attorneys see a 1.76% click-through rate on Facebook, but the real win is the 10.53% conversion rate. That's 31% better than last year. Yet most law firms still treat Facebook like a vanity metric game.

The data is clear: 28% of law firms rank Facebook as their top paid social platform. Meta's algorithm updates dropped cost-per-lead by 77% for legal services in the past year. Mobile-first creative? It outperforms desktop by 33-52%.

But here's what separates winners from the rest: tracking CVR and CPL instead of clicks. Stop chasing volume. Start chasing conversions.
