#### ![](https://businessunitprofile-cdn.trustpilot.net/businessunitprofile-consumersite/public/trustpilot-shield.svg)   \#\#\#\# We use technology to protect platform integrity, but we don't fact-check reviews

While we don't verify specific claims because reviewers' opinions are their own, we may label reviews as "Verified" when we can confirm a business interaction took place. [Read more](https://help.trustpilot.com/s/article/Trustpilots-review-labels?language=en_US)

To protect platform integrity, every review on our platform—verified or not—is screened by our 24/7 automated software. This technology is designed to identify and remove content that breaches our guidelines, including reviews that are not based on a genuine experience. We recognise we may not catch everything, and you can flag anything you think we may have missed.
