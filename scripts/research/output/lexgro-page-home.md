Frequently Asked Questions

Find answers to common questions about our services, pricing, and how LEXGRO can support your law firm's growth.

Why is Digital Marketing non-Negotiable for Law Firms?

Digital marketing is needed, as most potential clients are finding legal services online rather than through word-of-mouth or print advertising. Studies have shown that more than 85% of people use search engines to locate local businesses, including lawyers. Without a sound online strategy, law firms can be invisible to the people who are actively seeking help. It is about reaching out to clients where they are and establishing trust before they enter the front door.Real Results: A midsize personal injury firm experienced a 45% increase in qualified online leads in six months following the implementation of an SEO and PPC campaign, and 30 new cases were generated from that effort. Takeaway: Invest in digital marketing to make your law firm visible and credible to today's online-first clients.

What are some of the special considerations for law firms utilizing online marketing?

Law firms are unique in that they are bound by strict ethical guidelines, legal work is highly sensitive, and competition is intense. They are required to adhere to ABA advertising regulations, maintain client confidentiality, and avoid making claims of guaranteed results. Trust and differentiation in a crowded online environment demand a uniquely compliant approach. It's a delicate balance between visibility and integrity. Real Results: One family law firm worked with an agency that provided ethical checks on all content, increasing client consultations by 25% with no compliance issues.Bottom line: Legal marketing is a combination of digital expertise and a strong grasp of ethical and regulatory standards.

What is the effect of digital marketing on law firm's reputation?

Digital marketing can impact a law firm's reputation by affecting online reviews, thought leadership articles, and the quality of the website. A good digital presence establishes trust and demonstrates expertise. A lack of online presence, or a weak online presence, can harm credibility or leave a firm susceptible to negative opinions. It's word of mouth, the new way, but on a global scale.Real Results: With the help of a proactive online reputation plan, a real estate law firm improved its average Google review from 3.8 to 4.7 stars and experienced a significant increase in referral traffic.Takeaway: A solid digital strategy is crucial for establishing and maintaining your firm's online reputation.

Can small law firms really compete for business online with larger firms?

Some of the most common mistakes include neglecting SEO, failing to produce client-focused content, and neglecting online reputation management. Many companies strive for vanity numbers over actual leads and treat digital marketing as a one-time event rather than an investment. Another benefit of hiring an expert is that without an understanding of the law, you might make marketing mistakes that have ethical implications. These missteps squander opportunities and damage trust.Real Results: A company that was using traditional ads only did not see any online growth. After moving to a data-driven approach, they reduced their cost per lead by 30% in nine months.Takeaway: To dodge pitfalls, prioritize SEO, compliant content, and routine performance checks.
