Half your firm's marketing budget goes nowhere.

74% of law firms admit to wasting money on campaigns that don't move the needle. Yet most are still allocating 2-10% of revenue to marketing—well below what other professional services invest.

Here's what's actually working in 2026: firms that tie every dollar to measurable outcomes. The data shows SEO generates the strongest ROI (45% of smart budgets), but 82% of firms say their paid search isn't delivering.

The gap between underperformers and market leaders? Strategic allocation. Firms increasing budgets are getting selective—not just spending more, but spending smarter on channels with proven return.

If your marketing feels scattered, it's probably because your budget mirrors the industry norm instead of your firm's growth ambitions.
