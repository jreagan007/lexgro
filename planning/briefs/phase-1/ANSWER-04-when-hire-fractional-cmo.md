## Content Outline

### Quick Answer (Featured Snippet Target - 60 words)
You should consider hiring a fractional CMO when: your marketing feels chaotic or inconsistent, you're spending money without seeing results, no one is accountable for marketing strategy, or your growth has plateaued. Most law firms reach this point at $500K-$3M in revenue, but the signs matter more than the number.

### Section 2: Revenue and Size Benchmarks (400-500 words)
**H2: Is Your Firm Big Enough for a Fractional CMO?**

**Revenue Benchmarks:**

| Revenue | Marketing Situation | Recommendation |
|---------|---------------------|----------------|
| Under $300K | Just getting started | DIY or very targeted spend |
| $300K-$500K | Need some help | Focused agency or part-time support |
| $500K-$1M | Outgrowing DIY | Strong candidate for fractional CMO |
| $1M-$3M | Sweet spot | Ideal for fractional CMO |
| $3M-$5M | Scaling | Fractional CMO or marketing director |
| $5M+ | Growth mode | Consider full-time CMO |

**But Revenue Isn't Everything:**
- Marketing spend matters more
- If you're spending $5K+/month on marketing, you need oversight
- If you're making marketing decisions daily, you need help

**The Real Question:**
- Can you afford to NOT have marketing leadership?
- What is chaos costing you?
- What is owner distraction worth?

**Real Results:** Law firm at $600K that added fractional CMO → $1.2M in 18 months

### Section 3: When It's Too Early (300-400 words)
**H2: When a Fractional CMO Isn't Right (Yet)**

Be honest—not every firm needs a fractional CMO. It may be too early if:

**You're Not Ready If:**
- [ ] Revenue under $300K
- [ ] No marketing budget to manage
- [ ] Not growth-minded (lifestyle practice is fine)
- [ ] Haven't done any marketing yet
- [ ] Can't commit $5K+/month to marketing leadership

**Better Alternatives at This Stage:**
- Focus on referrals and networking
- Basic DIY marketing (website, Google Business)
- Very targeted agency for one channel
- Marketing consultant for specific project

**From Keith:** "I turn away firms that aren't ready. Here's why..."

**The transition point:**
When you're spending money on marketing and can't tell if it's working—that's when you need oversight.

### Section 4: The Cost of Waiting (300-400 words)
**H2: What Happens If You Wait Too Long**

**The Hidden Costs of No Marketing Leadership:**

1. **Wasted Marketing Spend**
   - Average law firm wastes 30-50% of marketing budget
   - No one to optimize spend
   - Agencies not held accountable

2. **Opportunity Cost**
   - Cases you're not getting
   - Revenue left on table
   - Competitors capturing your market

3. **Owner Time Cost**
   - Hours spent on marketing = hours not billing
   - Mental bandwidth drained
   - Decision fatigue

4. **Compounding Effect**
   - Marketing builds over time
   - Every month delayed = months of compound growth lost
   - Competitors are building while you wait

**Real Results:** Law firm that waited 2 years → Estimated $400K in lost revenue from poor marketing

### Section 5: How to Know You're Ready (200-300 words)
**H2: The Readiness Checklist**

You're ready for a fractional CMO if:

- [ ] You're spending (or ready to spend) $5K+/month on marketing
- [ ] Marketing is causing you stress or distraction
- [ ] You want to grow but don't know how
- [ ] You've tried DIY or agency and it's not working
- [ ] You're willing to invest in strategy, not just tactics
- [ ] You want someone accountable for marketing outcomes
- [ ] You can commit to 6+ months of engagement

**The Mindset Shift:**
- From: "Marketing is an expense to minimize"
- To: "Marketing is an investment to optimize"

**From Keith:** "The best clients come in ready to be strategic partners..."
