## Content Outline

### Quick Answer (Featured Snippet Target - 60 words)
A fractional CMO provides strategic marketing leadership and oversight, while a marketing agency provides tactical execution (SEO, PPC, content, etc.). Many law firms need both—but without a CMO, agencies lack direction. The key difference: a CMO's interests are aligned with your growth; an agency's interests are aligned with their retainer.

---

### Introduction (200-250 words)
- Hook: "I've seen this story too many times..."
- The frustration law firms have with agencies
- Why this comparison matters
- **From Keith:** Personal experience auditing agency relationships

### Section 1: The Core Difference (400-500 words)
**H2: Understanding the Fundamental Difference**

| Aspect | Fractional CMO | Marketing Agency |
|--------|----------------|------------------|
| **Role** | Strategic leader | Tactical executor |
| **Focus** | Your business goals | Campaign metrics |
| **Reports to** | You (like an employee) | You (like a vendor) |
| **Accountability** | Business outcomes | Deliverables |
| **Incentive** | Your growth | Their retainer |
| **Approach** | Holistic strategy | Channel-specific tactics |

**The Analogy:**
- CMO = Architect who designs the house
- Agency = Contractor who builds what's designed
- Without an architect: contractor builds what they want

**From Keith:** "The problem I see most often is..."

### Section 2: Why Marketing Agencies Often Fail Law Firms (500-600 words)
**H2: Why Agencies Fail Law Firms (And It's Not Always Their Fault)**

**The Structural Problem:**
1. **Agencies sell services, not outcomes**
   - They get paid for SEO, not for cases
   - No incentive to tell you SEO isn't right for you

2. **No one owns the strategy**
   - Account managers aren't strategists
   - They execute, they don't lead

3. **Misaligned interests**
   - Agency wants to keep the retainer
   - You want results
   - These don't always align

4. **The "more is better" trap**
   - Agencies recommend adding services
   - More services = more revenue (for them)
   - Not always more results (for you)

5. **Lack of legal industry knowledge**
   - Most agencies are generalists
   - Don't understand case economics
   - Can't calculate cost per case properly

**Real Results:** Example of law firm that was overspending because agency didn't understand their practice area

### Section 3: When an Agency Is the Right Choice (300-400 words)
**H2: When a Marketing Agency Makes Sense**

Don't get me wrong—agencies aren't bad. They're right when:

1. **You have clear strategy already**
   - You know what channels work
   - You just need execution
   - Someone is already overseeing strategy

2. **You need specialized execution**
   - Complex PPC management
   - High-volume content production
   - Technical SEO implementation

3. **You need scale**
   - Too much for one person
   - Need a team of specialists

4. **You have internal marketing leadership**
   - Marketing director or manager
   - Can hold agency accountable

**Takeaway:** Agencies are great at "how" but need direction on "what"

### Section 4: When a Fractional CMO Is the Right Choice (300-400 words)
**H2: When a Fractional CMO Makes Sense**

A fractional CMO is right when:

1. **You have no marketing leadership**
   - No one owns strategy
   - You (the attorney) are making marketing decisions
   - No one holds vendors accountable

2. **You're spending money but not seeing results**
   - You have an agency but it's not working
   - You're doing marketing but it feels random

3. **You need to build a marketing function**
   - Hiring a team
   - Selecting vendors
   - Creating processes

4. **You want strategic direction, not more tactics**
   - "Do less, better" approach
   - Focus resources on what works
   - Stop wasting money

5. **You can't afford (or don't need) a full-time CMO**
   - Revenue under $10M
   - Don't need 40 hours/week

**From Keith:** "The firms that benefit most are..."

### Section 5: The Best Approach (500-600 words)
**H2: The Truth: You Might Need Both**

**The Optimal Setup for Growing Law Firms:**

```
You (Managing Partner)
        ↓
Fractional CMO (Strategy & Oversight)
        ↓
Marketing Agency (Execution)
        +
Internal Marketing (Coordination)
```

**How This Works:**
- CMO sets strategy and priorities
- CMO selects and manages agency
- Agency executes tactics
- CMO holds agency accountable
- CMO reports results to you

**Why This Works:**
- Clear accountability chain
- Aligned interests at the top
- Execution expertise below
- One person responsible for outcomes

**Cost Comparison:**

| Approach | Monthly Cost | What You Get |
|----------|--------------|--------------|
| Agency only | $10K | Tactics without strategy |
| Fractional CMO only | $8K | Strategy without execution |
| CMO + Agency | $18K | Strategy AND execution |
| Full-time CMO + Agency | $25K+ | Same, but more expensive |

**Real Results:** Law firm that added fractional CMO to oversee existing agency—results improved 3x

### Section 6: Questions to Decide (200-300 words)
**H2: How to Decide What's Right for Your Firm**

**Ask yourself:**

1. Do I have someone who owns marketing strategy (not tactics)?
   - If no → Start with fractional CMO

2. Is my current agency working?
   - If no → Add CMO oversight before switching agencies

3. Do I know which marketing channels work for my firm?
   - If no → CMO first, then agency

4. Do I have time to manage our marketing?
   - If no → You need leadership, not more vendors

5. What's my budget?
   - Under $5K/month: DIY or very focused agency
   - $5K-$15K/month: Fractional CMO or agency (not both)
   - $15K+/month: Consider both

**Takeaway:** If you don't know why your marketing isn't working, adding another agency won't help.

### FAQ Section (300-400 words)
**FAQPage Schema - 6-7 questions:**
