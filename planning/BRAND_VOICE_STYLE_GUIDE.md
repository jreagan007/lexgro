## Brand Voice

### Core Voice Attributes

| Attribute | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **Authoritative** | Speaks from experience, not theory | "I've seen this pattern in dozens of law firms..." |
| **Direct** | Gets to the point, no fluff | "Here's what actually works." |
| **Results-Focused** | Always ties back to outcomes | "This strategy generated 30% more leads in 6 months." |
| **Empowering** | Builds confidence, not dependency | "You can implement this yourself, or we can help." |
| **Honest** | Transparent about what works and what doesn't | "SEO isn't right for every firm. Here's how to know." |

### Voice Do's and Don'ts

| DO | DON'T |
|----|-------|
| Use specific numbers and results | Use vague claims ("best", "leading") |
| Acknowledge challenges honestly | Overpromise or guarantee results |
| Speak from experience ("I've seen...") | Sound academic or theoretical |
| Offer actionable takeaways | Leave readers without next steps |
| Use "law firm partner" language | Use "client" language that creates distance |
| Address pain points directly | Dance around difficult topics |

### Keith's Speaking Style

**First-person perspective when appropriate:**
- "In my experience working with PI firms..."
- "I've helped law firms scale from $3M to $11M, and here's what I've learned..."
- "When I audit a law firm's marketing, the first thing I look at is..."

**Direct address to the reader:**
- "If you're running a solo practice in a competitive market..."
- "Your intake process is likely costing you cases. Here's why."
- "Most law firms I work with are surprised to learn..."

**Real talk, not sales talk:**
- "Let me be honest: SEO isn't right for every firm."
- "Before you spend another dollar on Google Ads, read this."
- "I'm going to share something most marketing agencies won't tell you."

---

## Tone Guidelines

### Primary Tone: Confident Expert

Keith speaks as someone who has done this work, not someone theorizing about it. The tone should convey:

- **Competence:** "I know what I'm talking about because I've done it."
- **Empathy:** "I understand the challenges you're facing."
- **Directness:** "Here's exactly what you need to do."
- **Support:** "You're not alone in this."

### Tone by Content Type

| Content Type | Tone | Example |
|--------------|------|---------|
| **Pillar Guides** | Authoritative, comprehensive | "This is everything you need to know about law firm SEO." |
| **Answer Pages** | Helpful, direct | "Here's the straight answer, plus what most people miss." |
| **Blog Posts** | Conversational, insightful | "I was on a call with a PI attorney last week who asked..." |
| **Service Pages** | Confident, value-focused | "This is how we help law firms achieve predictable growth." |

### Emotional Resonance

**Pain points to acknowledge:**
- Frustration with marketing agencies that don't deliver
- Overwhelm from trying to do marketing themselves
- Confusion about which channels actually work
- Fear of wasting money on bad marketing
- Desire for predictable, consistent growth

**Aspirations to speak to:**
- Building a firm that runs without constant owner involvement
- Achieving predictable revenue and consistent case flow
- Becoming the dominant firm in their market
- Having marketing that actually works

---

## Writing Style

### Sentence Structure

- Lead with the main point
- Use short sentences for emphasis
- Break up long explanations with subheads
- End sections with clear takeaways

**Example:**
> Most law firms waste money on marketing because they don't have a strategy. They chase tactics—SEO one month, Google Ads the next, a new website after that. None of it compounds.
>
> **The fix:** Start with strategy, then choose tactics that support it.

### Formatting Conventions

**Real Results blocks:**
```
**Real Results:** A midsize PI firm increased qualified leads by 45% in six months after implementing this strategy.
```

**Takeaway blocks:**
```
**Takeaway:** Invest in marketing leadership before marketing tactics.
```

**Keith's Perspective blocks:**
```
**From Keith:** "I've audited hundreds of law firm marketing programs, and the #1 problem is always the same: no one is actually in charge of marketing strategy."
```

### Numbers and Data

- Use specific numbers when available: "45% increase" not "significant increase"
- Reference timeframes: "in 6 months" not "quickly"
- Include context: "$150,000 annual savings" not just "cost savings"
- Use ranges when exact numbers aren't available: "typically 30-50%"

### Legal Marketing Terminology

**Use:**
- Case generation (not lead generation)
- Cost per case / cost per acquisition
- Intake conversion rate
- Signed cases
- Practice area
- Law firm partner (when referring to clients)

**Avoid:**
- Leads (use "potential clients" or "inquiries")
- Customers (use "clients")
- Sales (use "intake" or "client acquisition")
