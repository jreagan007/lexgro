Facebook advertising for law firms just had its best year. Legal services now see a 10.53 percent conversion rate on the platform, up 31.35 percent from last year. The average cost per lead dropped 77 percent to just $18.17.

Those numbers beat most other industries. And they explain why 28 percent of law firms now rank Facebook Ads as their top paid social platform, beating Google Ads at 19 percent.

But most firms still get Facebook wrong. Here's how to get it right.

## The 2025-2026 Facebook Benchmarks for Law Firms

The numbers don't lie. Legal services on Facebook deliver:

- **Click-through rate:** 1.76 percent (industry average 1.44 to 2.59 percent)
- **Cost per click:** $0.86 (general average $0.54 to $1.92)
- **Conversion rate:** 10.53 percent (up 31.35 percent year over year)
- **Cost per lead:** $18.17 (down 77 percent year over year)

Compare that to the general legal cost per lead, which can reach $78.26. Facebook, done right, costs a fraction of traditional PPC.

## When Facebook Ads Make Sense

Facebook is fundamentally different from Google PPC advertising.

On Google, people actively search for a lawyer. High intent. Ready to hire.

On Facebook, people scroll past cat videos and birthday posts. Low intent. Not thinking about legal problems.

This means Facebook works differently. You're not capturing demand. You're creating it.

That works for some situations:

- **Building awareness** before people need you
- **Retargeting** people who visited your website
- **Reaching specific demographics** Google can't target
- **Practice areas with longer consideration cycles** like estate planning

It works less well for:

- Emergency legal needs (criminal defense, accidents)
- High-intent searches where Google dominates
- Complex B2B legal services

## Targeting That Works

Facebook's power is in targeting. Lead generation campaigns achieve a 2.53 percent click-through rate, 61 percent higher than traffic campaigns.

### Demographic Targeting

Target by:

- Age
- Location
- Homeownership
- Income level
- Life events (new job, newly engaged, new baby)

Life events are particularly powerful. Someone who just got engaged might need a prenup. Someone who just had a baby might need estate planning.

### Interest-Based Targeting

Target people interested in:

- Related topics (parenting for family law, finance for estate planning)
- Competitors
- Legal information

### Lookalike Audiences

Upload your client list. Facebook finds similar people. These lookalike audiences often perform well because they share characteristics with your existing clients.

### Retargeting

Show ads to people who:

- Visited your website
- Engaged with your Facebook page
- Watched your videos
- Submitted forms but didn't hire

Retargeting audiences are warm. They already know you. Conversion rates are typically higher.

## Mobile Dominates Everything

Mobile claims 94 to 98 percent of Facebook traffic. Mobile users see 33 to 52 percent higher click-through rates than desktop.

This changes everything about creative:

- Design for small screens first
- Use vertical video formats
- Make text readable without pinching
- Keep forms short
- Enable click-to-call

## Video and Reels Outperform

Video ads on Facebook and Instagram hit 1.94 to 3.0 percent click-through rates. Reels cost 10 to 30 percent less per thousand impressions than standard placements.

Video doesn't mean expensive production. Simple, authentic content often works better than polished commercials.

Ideas that work:

- Attorney explaining a common legal question (60 to 90 seconds)
- Client testimonials (with permission)
- Behind-the-scenes at the firm
- Quick tips answering frequent questions

## Ad Creative That Converts

### Lead with Value

Nobody cares about your firm. They care about their problems.

**Weak:** "Smith Law Firm has 20 years of experience in family law."

**Strong:** "Worried about protecting your kids in a divorce? Here's what courts actually consider."

Start with the problem. Then offer the solution.

### Clear Call to Action

Every ad needs a clear next step.

- Schedule a free consultation
- Download a free guide
- Watch this video
- Learn more

Don't make people guess what to do next.

### Placement Performance

Not all placements perform equally:

- Instagram Stories: 1.34 percent CTR
- Facebook Feed: 1.11 percent CTR
- Facebook Reels: 0.94 percent CTR

Test placements and double down on what works for your practice area.

## Landing Pages Matter

The ad gets the click. The landing page gets the conversion.

Don't send Facebook traffic to your homepage. Create dedicated landing pages that:

- Match the ad's message
- Load fast on mobile
- Have a single, clear call to action
- Include trust elements (reviews, credentials)

The best Facebook campaigns fail if landing pages don't convert.

## Budgeting Realistically

Facebook advertising requires sufficient budget to learn and optimize.

**Minimum viable budget:** $1,000 to $2,000 per month per campaign

Below that, you don't generate enough data to optimize effectively. Meta's algorithm needs around 50 conversions per week to optimize properly.

As you find what works, scale budget toward winning campaigns and away from losers.

## Measuring Results

Track what matters:

- Cost per click
- Cost per lead ($18.17 is the benchmark)
- Lead quality (what percentage become consultations?)
- Cost per consultation
- Cost per signed case

Facebook's reporting shows vanity metrics. Reach. Impressions. Engagement. None of that matters if it doesn't translate to cases.

About 97 percent of legal professionals using PPC (including Facebook) say it's too expensive for the ROI. Most are measuring the wrong things.

Connect Facebook to your CRM. Track the full journey from ad impression to signed client.

## Common Mistakes

### Targeting Too Broadly

A million-person audience sounds good but wastes money. Narrow targeting reaches people more likely to need your services.

### Expecting Immediate Results

Facebook is a longer game than Google. You're building awareness and trust over time. Don't expect instant leads from cold audiences.

### Weak Creative

Boring ads get ignored. Invest in creative that stops the scroll and communicates value in the first 3 seconds.

### No Retargeting

Retargeting is usually your highest-ROI Facebook campaign. If you're not retargeting website visitors, you're missing easy wins. A strong law firm SEO strategy drives the organic traffic you can then retarget.

### Poor Landing Pages

A great ad leading to a bad landing page is money wasted. Invest as much in conversion as in traffic.

## A Sample Strategy

Here's how I typically structure Facebook for law firms.

**Campaign 1: Awareness**
- Target: Lookalike of existing clients
- Creative: Educational video content
- Goal: Introduce the firm to new audiences
- Budget: 40 percent of total

**Campaign 2: Retargeting**
- Target: Website visitors who didn't convert
- Creative: Testimonials and social proof
- Goal: Convert warm leads
- Budget: 30 percent of total

**Campaign 3: Lead Generation**
- Target: Life events and interests relevant to practice area
- Creative: Lead magnet (free guide, checklist)
- Goal: Capture contact information
- Budget: 30 percent of total

This structure builds awareness, captures leads, and converts warm audiences.

## The Bottom Line

Facebook advertising can work extremely well for law firms. The 10.53 percent conversion rate and $18.17 cost per lead prove it.

But it requires realistic expectations and strategic execution. It's not a replacement for Google. It's a complement. It builds awareness, nurtures leads, and captures audiences Google can't reach.

Done right, Facebook becomes a steady source of qualified leads at costs that beat traditional PPC. Done wrong, it's an expensive lesson.
