Not all personal injury cases are equal. The average PI settlement hits [$52,000](https://digital1010.com/blog/personal-injury-lawyer-google-ads-strategies-quality-cases-2025/). Medical malpractice averages $250,000 to $2 million. Wrongful death often exceeds $1 million.

High-value cases make careers. Low-value cases drain resources. Here are 10 tactics to attract the cases worth pursuing.

## 1. Target High-Value Case Types Directly

Stop marketing generic "personal injury." Target specific case types with higher average values.

Trucking accidents generate larger settlements than fender benders. Medical malpractice cases typically exceed $250,000. Wrongful death claims often reach seven figures. Product liability cases can hit eight figures.

Create dedicated landing pages for each case type. Build separate PPC campaigns. Write content that demonstrates expertise in these specific areas.

One firm that niched down to only trucking accidents doubled their average case value within two years.

## 2. Invest in SEO for Expensive Keywords

High-value case searches carry high costs. ["Truck accident lawyer"](https://www.ilawyermarketing.com/most-expensive-google-ads-keywords-legal-industry-2025/) keywords cost $450 to $1,000 per click in PPC. Medical malpractice terms run $300 to $600.

SEO delivers these searches without per-click costs. Organic search drives [52.6 percent of law firm traffic](https://www.andava.com/learn/legal-marketing-statistics/) and converts at 7.5 percent. That is more than three times the PPC conversion rate of 2.2 percent.

The investment pays off. Firms spend $60,000 to $150,000 per year on SEO but achieve 526 percent ROI over three years.

## 3. Build Strategic Referral Relationships

Many high-value cases never see advertising. They come through referrals from other attorneys who do not handle PI or from specialists working different parts of the case.

Build relationships intentionally. Network with estate planning attorneys who encounter wrongful death situations. Connect with business litigators who see commercial accidents. Partner with medical malpractice specialists in complementary areas.

Referral cases convert better and cost nothing to acquire.

## 4. Showcase Results by Case Type

If ethics rules permit, highlight your best results prominently. A seven-figure verdict gets attention.

Display results by case type so prospects see you have handled situations like theirs. "We recovered $3.2 million for a trucking accident victim" speaks directly to someone searching for a truck accident lawyer.

Specific numbers build credibility faster than vague claims about being "aggressive" or "experienced."

## 5. Create Expert Content That Demonstrates Depth

High-value cases often involve complex issues. Surface-level content does not attract sophisticated clients.

Write about trucking regulations and federal compliance requirements. Explain medical malpractice standards of care in specific specialties. Discuss product liability law and manufacturing defect cases.

Content that demonstrates deep expertise attracts the complex cases worth handling.

## 6. Train Intake to Recognize High-Value Cases

High-value cases require excellent intake. The client's first impression matters.

Train your team to recognize potential million-dollar cases. Build a process for escalating them to senior attorneys quickly. A skilled intake specialist should identify red flags like commercial vehicle involvement, severe injuries, or clear liability.

Do not let a significant case slip away because of a poor initial experience.

## 7. Use Video to Build Trust Fast

Video builds trust faster than text. High-value clients want to know who they are hiring.

Create videos that introduce your attorneys, explain complex case types, share client testimonials, and answer common questions.

Quality matters more for high-value practice areas. Invest in professional production for content targeting medical malpractice or catastrophic injury clients.

One firm added a 2-minute "Meet the Attorney" video to their homepage and saw a 40 percent increase in form submissions.

## 8. Track Marketing ROI by Case Type

Know your cost per case for different practice areas. You might pay more to acquire high-value cases, but the ROI is better.

A $3,000 cost per acquisition on a $50,000 soft tissue case yields 16x return. The same $3,000 on a $500,000 medical malpractice case yields 166x return.

Optimize toward profit, not lead volume. See our [marketing budget guide](/guide/law-firm-marketing-budget-planning/) for benchmarks.

## 9. Respond Immediately, Day and Night

High-value cases do not wait for business hours. Accidents happen nights and weekends. Urgent situations require urgent response.

[67 percent of clients](https://www.andava.com/learn/legal-marketing-statistics/) hire based on response speed. A 5-minute response produces 400 percent higher conversions. And 80 percent of prospects switch firms if they do not hear back within 48 hours.

Have a system to respond immediately to serious inquiries. One firm implemented 24/7 live answering and saw [31 percent higher conversion rates](https://fwd-lawyermarketing.com/how-to-get-more-injury-cases-through-google-ads-in-2025/) within 30 days.

## 10. Position on Expertise, Not Volume

High-value clients want the best, not the biggest.

Position your firm as specialists, not generalists. "We focus on catastrophic injuries" beats "We handle all accident cases." Specificity signals expertise.

The firms handling seven and eight figure cases are known for something specific. They do not try to be everything to everyone.

## The Math That Matters

One significant case can generate more revenue than dozens of minor ones.

A firm handling 100 soft tissue cases at $15,000 each generates $1.5 million. A firm handling 10 catastrophic injury cases at $300,000 each generates $3 million with far less operational burden.

High-value marketing requires intentional strategy. Target specific case types. Demonstrate expertise. Deliver excellent client experience from first contact.
