Most law firms spend between 2% and 10% of gross revenue on marketing. The professional services benchmark is 7% to 10%. That gap explains why so many firms feel stuck.

But spending more is not the fix. According to multiple industry surveys, 74% of law firm marketing budgets go toward low-ROI activities. The problem is not the budget size. The problem is where the money goes.

This report pulls data from the 2025 LMA ATL CMO Survey, ABA marketing reports, and published benchmarks from Practice Proof, Revenue Memo, and Pareto Legal. It covers what firms spend, where they allocate, and what the top performers do differently.

## Only Half of Firms Have a Marketing Budget

According to [Revenue Memo's aggregated survey data](https://www.revenuememo.com/p/law-firm-marketing-statistics), only 47% to 49% of law firms have a formal annual marketing budget. The rest spend reactively, writing checks for ads, agencies, or sponsorships without a plan connecting spend to growth.

That number is striking. It means more than half of all law firms make marketing decisions without a documented budget. They cannot track ROI because they never defined what they intended to spend.

The firms with formal budgets report better outcomes. They track cost per case. They know which channels produce signed clients. They reallocate quarterly based on data. The budget itself is not magic. The discipline it creates is.

## Budget as a Percentage of Revenue

Revenue allocation varies by firm size, growth goals, and competitive pressure. Here are the ranges from multiple surveys.

| Firm Profile | Revenue Allocation | Annual Budget ($3M Firm) |
|---|---|---|
| Established, referral-dependent | 2-5% | $60,000 to $150,000 |
| Small firm, stable market | 5-7% | $150,000 to $210,000 |
| Mid-sized, moderate growth | 7-10% | $210,000 to $300,000 |
| Aggressive growth, competitive metro | 10-15% | $300,000 to $450,000 |

[Practice Proof's 2026 benchmarks](https://www.practiceproof.com/law-firm-marketing-benchmarks-for-2026/) place the typical law firm at 2% to 10% of gross revenue. [Elite Legal Marketing](https://www.elitelegalmarketing.com/how-much-law-firm-spend-marketing/) reports a similar range, noting that firms in competitive personal injury or mass tort markets regularly exceed 10%.

The professional services industry standard is 7% to 10%. Most law firms fall below that number. It shows in their pipeline.

## Where the Money Goes: Channel Allocation

Not all marketing dollars are equal. The channel split matters more than the total spend. Data from [Pareto Legal](https://pareto.legal/legal-marketing-statistics-in-2026/) and [SEOProfy](https://seoprofy.com/blog/legal-marketing-statistics/) shows how firms divide their digital marketing budgets.

| Channel | Budget Share | Annual Spend ($200K Budget) |
|---|---|---|
| SEO and content | 45% | $90,000 |
| PPC and paid ads | 30% | $60,000 |
| Social media | 10% | $20,000 |
| Traditional (print, events, sponsorships) | 15% | $30,000 |

According to the same data, 40% of firms put 76% to 100% of their marketing budget toward online channels. The shift away from traditional marketing is accelerating. Print ads, sponsorships, and conference booths still play a role for brand visibility, but they rarely drive measurable case acquisition.

Annual SEO spend for firms doing it well runs $120,000 to $150,000. That covers technical optimization, content production, link building, and local SEO across multiple practice areas.

The 45% SEO allocation is not arbitrary. SEO produces the lowest cost per case of any digital channel. It compounds over time. A blog post written in January generates leads in June, September, and the following January. Paid ads stop the moment you stop paying. The math favors SEO for any firm with a 12-month planning horizon.

## Budget Trends: Who Is Increasing Spend

The 2025 LMA ATL CMO Survey found that 54% of firms increased their marketing budgets after adjusting for inflation. That number jumped to 74% for mid-sized firms with 51 to 100 attorneys.

Firm size drives the trend.

| Firm Size | Planning Budget Increases |
|---|---|
| Small (under 25 employees) | 69% |
| Large (26+ employees) | 79% |

[ABA-cited research](https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/law-firm-marketing-budget-allocation-1253951/) reports 36% of all firms increased budgets. The gap between the ABA figure and the LMA figure reflects methodology differences, but both surveys point in the same direction: most firms are spending more, not less.

The total US legal advertising market exceeded $2.5 billion in 2024. Industry projections put it above $3 billion by 2026. Competition for attention is not decreasing.

What does that mean for your firm? If competitors are raising budgets and you hold flat, you lose ground. Not because your marketing got worse, but because the market got more expensive. The same budget buys fewer clicks, fewer impressions, and fewer leads than it did 12 months ago. Standing still is falling behind.

## The Waste Problem

Here is the number that should concern every managing partner: [74% of law firm marketing spend goes toward low-ROI activities](https://www.mycase.com/blog/law-firm-marketing/law-firm-marketing-statistics/). That is not a typo. Three quarters of marketing budgets produce poor returns.

The waste shows up in specific places.

**Paid search mismanagement.** According to [Taqtics' analysis](https://taqtics.com/blog/law-firm-marketing/), 82% of firms report poor paid search ROI. The problem is usually the same: broad match keywords, no negative keyword lists, landing pages that do not convert, and no call tracking. Firms pay $150 to $300 per click and send traffic to a generic homepage.

**No measurement.** About 22% of firms struggle to measure marketing results at all. If you cannot connect spend to signed cases, every dollar is a guess.

**Wrong channel priorities.** Many firms over-invest in social media (10% of budget for 2% to 3% of leads) and under-invest in SEO (which delivers the highest conversion rates across every study). The allocation follows what feels active, not what produces cases.

**Agency misalignment.** Firms hire agencies that report vanity metrics: impressions, clicks, traffic. None of those numbers mean anything unless they connect to consultations and signed clients. Reporting without revenue attribution is just noise.

**No channel attribution.** Most firms cannot answer a simple question: which channel produced last month's signed cases? Without call tracking, intake source tagging, and CRM integration, you cannot know which channels deserve more budget and which ones deserve less. You end up funding everything equally, which means you overspend on losers and underspend on winners.

The common thread across all five failure points is the same. No system. No measurement. No accountability. The budget exists as a line item, not as a growth tool.

## What Top-Performing Firms Do Differently

The firms growing fastest share several patterns. None of them are secrets. All of them require discipline.

**They allocate 45% or more of digital budget to SEO.** SEO compounds. Every piece of content, every optimized page, every earned link builds long-term value. Paid ads stop producing the moment you stop paying. SEO keeps working.

**They track cost per signed case, not cost per lead.** A lead is not a client. Top firms measure the full funnel: click to lead, lead to consultation, consultation to retained. They know the real acquisition cost and they compare it across channels every month.

**They have a formal budget tied to revenue goals.** They start with a target revenue number, work backward to case volume, calculate the required leads, and budget from there. Every dollar connects to an outcome.

**They review and reallocate quarterly.** Markets shift. Channels change. A PPC campaign that worked in Q1 might stall in Q3. Top firms move money toward what works and cut what does not. They do not wait for the annual planning cycle.

**They invest in conversion, not just traffic.** Website speed, intake response time, follow-up sequences, and consultation processes all affect how many leads become clients. A firm that converts 40% of consultations needs half the leads of a firm converting 20%. Conversion improvement is the highest-ROI investment most firms ignore.

## Budget Allocation Recommendations by Firm Size

These recommendations combine the survey data above with what we see working across LEXGRO clients.

### Small Firms (1 to 10 Attorneys)

**Target spend:** 7% to 10% of gross revenue.

Start with two channels done well. SEO and Google Business Profile should take 60% of the budget. Use the remaining 40% on one paid channel (Google Ads or Local Service Ads, not both). Do not spread $8,000 per month across five platforms.

Build content around your top two practice areas. Answer the questions your prospects actually ask. Track cost per consultation and cost per signed case from day one.

The biggest mistake small firms make is hiring a generalist agency and spreading $5,000 per month across SEO, PPC, social media, and email. That budget cannot produce results in any single channel. Pick one or two channels, fund them properly, and add more as revenue grows.

### Mid-Sized Firms (11 to 50 Attorneys)

**Target spend:** 10% to 12% of gross revenue.

You need dedicated marketing leadership. A [fractional CMO](/services/fractional-cmo/) or senior marketing director should own the budget, the strategy, and the reporting. Without leadership, mid-sized firms waste more than small firms because the dollars are bigger and the decisions are more complex.

Allocate 45% to SEO and content, 30% to paid acquisition, 15% to brand and events, and 10% to testing new channels. Review performance monthly. Reallocate quarterly.

At this size, the gap between firms with marketing leadership and firms without it grows fast. A 30-attorney firm spending $30,000 per month without a strategic plan will underperform a 15-attorney firm spending $15,000 with clear goals, channel attribution, and quarterly reviews.

### Large Firms (50+ Attorneys)

**Target spend:** 7% to 10% of gross revenue (higher absolute dollars).

Large firms can afford specialization. Hire or contract specialists for SEO, paid media, and content. Run campaigns per practice area with dedicated budgets and tracking. What works for your personal injury group will not work for your estate planning group.

Reserve 10% to 15% of the marketing budget for testing. At scale, finding one new channel that works can generate millions in new revenue.

Large firms also face a unique coordination problem. Multiple practice group leaders compete for marketing budget. Without a centralized system for allocating spend by practice area ROI, politics drive the budget instead of data. The firm with the loudest partner gets the most budget, regardless of market opportunity.

## Stop Guessing, Start Measuring

The data tells a clear story. Most law firms underspend on marketing. The ones who spend enough often put money in the wrong places. And the majority cannot tell you which dollars produced which cases.

The fix is not complicated.

Set a budget tied to your revenue goal. Allocate by channel based on data, not gut feel. Track cost per signed case across every channel. Review quarterly and move money toward what works.
