Most PI firms track cost per lead. Few track cost per signed case. That gap is where money disappears.

The average Google Ads lead costs a PI firm $442. The average SEO lead costs $183. But those numbers only tell you what you paid for a phone call or form fill. They say nothing about whether that lead became a client.

This report breaks down 2026 CPL benchmarks by channel, case type, and region. More importantly, it follows the numbers through to signed cases, where the real economics live.

## Channel-by-Channel CPL Breakdown

Every channel carries a different cost and a different conversion profile. A $442 Google Ads lead that converts at 15% costs less per signed case than a $378 LSA lead that converts at 5%. The table below puts the full picture in one place.

| Channel | Avg CPL | CPC Range | Lead Conversion | Signed Case Rate | Cost Per Signed Case |
|---------|---------|-----------|-----------------|------------------|---------------------|
| Google Ads | $442 | $181 to $400 | 5 to 8% | 5 to 15% | $2,900 to $8,800 |
| SEO / Organic | $183 | N/A | 15 to 20% | 15 to 20% | $915 to $1,220 |
| Local Service Ads | $378 | N/A | 8 to 12% | 8 to 12% | $3,150 to $4,725 |
| TV / CTV | $300 to $600+ | $2 to $5 (branded) | 10 to 15% | 10 to 15% | $2,000 to $6,000 |
| Referrals | $0 to $100 | N/A | 15 to 20%+ | 15 to 20%+ | $0 to $667 |

A few things jump out.

SEO produces the cheapest leads and converts them at the highest rate. A $183 lead that signs at 15 to 20% translates to roughly $915 to $1,220 per signed case. That is 3 to 7 times cheaper than Google Ads on a per-case basis.

Referrals remain the best channel in pure economics. Near-zero acquisition cost and 15 to 20%+ conversion rates. The constraint is volume. You cannot scale referrals the way you scale paid media.

Google Ads and LSAs are expensive but immediate. When someone searches "car accident lawyer near me," they need help now. That urgency justifies the premium, but only if your intake process converts at the higher end of the range.

TV and CTV sit in a different category. The direct CPL runs $300 to $600+, but the real value shows up in branded search. When someone sees your ad and later Googles your firm name, that branded click costs $2 to $5 and converts at 25 to 40%. The attribution is harder to track, but the downstream economics can be strong.

## CPL by Case Type

Not all PI cases carry the same acquisition cost. Higher-value case types attract more competition, which drives up CPL.

| Case Type | Average CPL | Relative Cost |
|-----------|------------|---------------|
| Slip and Fall | $312 | Lowest |
| Workplace Injury | $354 | Below average |
| Auto Accident | $391 | Average |
| Product Liability | $476 | Above average |
| Medical Malpractice | $512 | Highest |

Medical malpractice leads cost 64% more than slip and fall leads. That premium reflects both the competition for high-value cases and the complexity of the intake process. Med mal cases require more screening, which means more leads fall out before signing.

Auto accident sits in the middle at $391. It is the highest-volume PI case type, which creates intense bidding competition on Google Ads. But volume also means more data to optimize against. Firms with strong conversion tracking can find pockets of efficiency that competitors miss.

Product liability at $476 reflects a smaller pool of available leads and specialized targeting requirements. These cases often require specific keyword strategies around product names, recalls, and manufacturer liability.

## Regional CPL Benchmarks

Geography shapes what you pay. Market size, attorney density, and local competition all factor in.

| Region | Average CPL | Difference from National Avg |
|--------|------------|------------------------------|
| Midwest | $314 | -19% |
| South | $389 | 0% (baseline) |
| West | $402 | +3% |
| Northeast | $468 | +20% |

Midwest firms pay 33% less per lead than Northeast firms. That $154 gap compounds fast across hundreds of leads per month.

The Northeast premium reflects dense metro markets like New York, Boston, and Philadelphia where attorney concentration is highest. More firms bidding on the same keywords drives CPC up, which pushes CPL up with it.

Southern markets sit near the national average. The West runs slightly above, driven primarily by California markets where PI competition is fierce in Los Angeles, San Francisco, and San Diego.

These regional numbers matter most for multi-market firms deciding where to allocate budget. A dollar spent in Indianapolis produces more leads than a dollar spent in Manhattan. That does not mean you should abandon high-cost markets. It means you should set different CPL targets by region and measure ROI independently.

## The Signed Case Economics

CPL tells you what a conversation costs. Cost per signed case tells you what a client costs. The gap between those two numbers is where most PI firms lose money.

Exclusive leads (generated by your own campaigns) run $1,500 to $2,500 per signed case across all channels. Shared leads from aggregators cost $3,000 to $6,000 per signed case because conversion rates drop when the same lead goes to three or four firms.

That 2 to 4x price difference makes the case for owning your lead generation. Every dollar you shift from shared lead sources to your own SEO, Google Ads, or LSA campaigns reduces your cost per signed case.

The math is straightforward. If your average case settles for $50,000 and your fee is 33%, your gross revenue per case is $16,500. At a $2,000 cost per signed case, your marketing ROI is 8.25:1. At $5,000 per signed case (shared leads), it drops to 3.3:1. Both are profitable. One is far more profitable.

## Conversion Rates: Where the Real Gains Live

Most PI firms focus on reducing CPL. The faster path to profitability is improving conversion rates.

Consider two scenarios with the same $442 Google Ads CPL.

**Scenario A:** 5% conversion to signed case. Cost per signed case: $8,840. On 100 leads, you sign five cases.

**Scenario B:** 15% conversion to signed case. Cost per signed case: $2,947. On 100 leads, you sign 15 cases.

Same spend. Same CPL. Three times the cases. The difference comes down to intake speed, follow-up cadence, and qualification accuracy.

The firms converting at 15% share common traits. They answer calls within 60 seconds. They follow up on missed calls within five minutes. They have trained intake specialists (not paralegals pulling double duty). And they track every lead from first touch to signed retainer in a CRM.

If your current conversion rate sits below 10%, fixing intake will produce a bigger ROI lift than any change to your ad campaigns. For more on the full PI marketing picture, see our [guide to personal injury lawyer marketing](/blog/personal-injury-lawyer-marketing/).

## Budget Allocation: Where to Put Your Dollars

Based on the CPL and conversion data above, here is how a mid-market PI firm should think about allocation.

| Channel | Recommended Allocation | Why |
|---------|----------------------|-----|
| Google Ads and LSAs | 40 to 50% | Immediate lead flow, high intent |
| SEO and Content | 20 to 30% | Lowest CPL, highest conversion, compounds over time |
| TV and CTV | 10 to 15% | Brand building, drives branded search volume |
| Referral Development | 5 to 10% | Best economics, limited scale |
| Social and Retargeting | 5 to 10% | Awareness and re-engagement |

Google Ads and LSAs take the largest share because they produce leads today. A new firm or a firm entering a new market needs immediate pipeline. Paid search delivers that.

SEO takes 20 to 30% because it is the highest-ROI channel over time. The CPL is less than half of Google Ads, and conversion rates are higher. But SEO takes six to 12 months to produce consistent results. You need paid search to bridge that gap.

TV and CTV at 10 to 15% makes sense for firms spending $50,000 or more per month on total marketing. Below that threshold, the budget is better concentrated in search channels. Above it, TV builds the brand awareness that makes every other channel more efficient.

Referral development at 5 to 10% covers relationship maintenance: dinners, events, co-marketing with medical providers, and structured referral programs. The economics are the best of any channel. The only limit is how many referral relationships you can actively maintain.

## What This Means for Your Firm

Three actions from this data.

**First, benchmark your own numbers against these tables.** If your Google Ads CPL is $600 when the average is $442, your campaign structure or targeting needs work. If your SEO CPL is $300 when the average is $183, your content strategy or technical foundation needs attention.

**Second, track through to signed cases.** CPL alone is a vanity metric. A $183 SEO lead and a $442 Google Ads lead might produce the same cost per signed case if conversion rates differ enough. Build attribution that follows leads from first click to signed retainer. Without that, you are optimizing blind.

**Third, fix intake before you fix campaigns.** If your lead-to-signed-case conversion rate is below 10%, the highest-ROI investment is intake training and process improvement, not more ad spend. Doubling your conversion rate has the same effect as cutting your CPL in half.

If you need help building a channel strategy around these benchmarks, our [Fractional CMO program for PI firms](/fractional-cmo/personal-injury/) provides the strategic layer most firms are missing. We set CPL targets by channel, build attribution models, and hold vendors accountable to signed-case economics.

The firms winning in PI marketing are not the ones spending the most. They are the ones who know exactly what each channel produces and allocate accordingly.
