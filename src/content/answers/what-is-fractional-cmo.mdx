# What Is a Fractional CMO?

A fractional CMO is a part-time Chief Marketing Officer who provides senior marketing leadership to your business. Instead of hiring a full-time executive, you engage an experienced marketing leader for a fraction of their time, typically 10 to 40 hours per month.

The "fractional" part refers to time, not expertise. These are executives with 15 to 25 years of marketing leadership experience who work with multiple clients simultaneously. You get the strategic brain without the full-time salary, benefits, and overhead.

For law firms, this model addresses a common problem. You need executive-level marketing thinking to grow, but you don't have the budget or workload to justify a full-time CMO. A fractional CMO bridges that gap.

## What Does a Fractional CMO Do?

A fractional CMO handles the same responsibilities as a full-time CMO, concentrated into fewer hours. Their focus is high-impact activities that increase case volume and improve marketing ROI.

**Strategy Development:** Every firm needs a marketing strategy. A fractional CMO identifies your ideal clients, positions your firm against competitors, allocates your budget across channels, and creates a roadmap for growth. Without strategy, you're just doing random marketing activities and hoping something works.

**Vendor Management:** Most law firms work with multiple marketing vendors: SEO agency, PPC manager, website developer, content writer. A fractional CMO coordinates these vendors, ensures they're aligned, and holds them accountable for results. When vendors know someone's watching, performance improves.

**Performance Tracking:** How do you know if marketing is working? A fractional CMO implements tracking systems that measure cost per lead, cost per case, and marketing ROI by channel. With this data, decision-making becomes straightforward: spend more on what works, less on what doesn't.

**Team Development:** If you have internal marketing staff, a fractional CMO provides strategic direction and professional development. They train your team on best practices and help them level up their skills.

**Executive Partnership:** Marketing decisions intersect with business decisions. A fractional CMO participates in leadership conversations, bringing the marketing perspective to discussions about pricing, positioning, and growth planning.

## How Is a Fractional CMO Different from an Agency?

This is one of the most common questions I hear. The difference comes down to role and accountability.

**Marketing agencies execute tactics.** They run your Google Ads, optimize your SEO, build your website, and produce content. They report on their activities and bill for their services.

**A fractional CMO sets strategy and provides oversight.** They determine which tactics you should pursue, which agencies you should hire, and whether those agencies are delivering results. They're accountable for overall marketing performance, not just one channel.

Think of it this way: an agency is like a specialist doctor who treats one condition. A fractional CMO is like your primary care physician who coordinates all your specialists and ensures your overall health.

Most firms that hire a fractional CMO keep their existing agencies. The CMO makes those agencies more effective by providing direction, coordination, and accountability.

## How Is a Fractional CMO Different from a Marketing Consultant?

The terms sometimes overlap, but there's an important distinction.

**Marketing consultants typically advise.** They analyze your situation, make recommendations, and hand you a plan. Implementation is your responsibility.

**Fractional CMOs lead.** They don't just tell you what to do. They become part of your leadership team and drive execution. They run meetings, manage vendors, make decisions, and own results.

A consultant says "here's what you should do." A fractional CMO says "here's what we're doing, and here's how it's going."

## What Does a Fractional CMO Cost?

Fractional CMO services typically range from $5,000 to $15,000 per month, depending on the level of involvement.

**Light engagement ($5,000 to $7,000 per month):** Strategic guidance, monthly strategy sessions, and vendor oversight. Typically 10 to 15 hours per month.

**Standard engagement ($8,000 to $12,000 per month):** Comprehensive strategy, weekly check-ins, hands-on vendor management, and team development. Typically 15 to 25 hours per month.

**Intensive engagement ($12,000 to $15,000 per month):** Deep involvement with multiple weekly touchpoints. Typically 25 to 40 hours per month.

Compare this to a full-time CMO. In major legal markets, marketing directors earn [$240,000 to $350,000 per year](https://www.ambitionsearch.com/blog/2024/08/legal-marketing-bd-and-communications-salary-guide-washington-dc/). Add benefits, bonuses, and overhead, and total cost reaches $300,000 to $450,000 annually.

A fractional CMO costs $60,000 to $180,000 per year. That's [50 to 80 percent savings](https://www.fisher-marketing.com/post/fisher-marketing-expands-fractional-cmo-services-in-2026) while getting similar strategic value.

## When Should You Hire a Fractional CMO?

A fractional CMO makes sense in specific situations.

**You're spending money but not seeing results.** If your marketing budget exceeds $5,000 per month and you can't clearly tie that spending to signed cases, you need strategic oversight.

**Your vendors lack direction.** Multiple agencies doing their own things isn't a strategy. Someone needs to set direction and coordinate efforts.

**You're ready to scale.** Growth requires planning. A fractional CMO builds the marketing roadmap for adding attorneys, opening offices, or expanding practice areas.

**You can't justify a full-time hire.** Until your firm reaches $10 million or more in revenue, a full-time CMO salary probably doesn't make sense. Fractional gets you the expertise at a manageable cost.

**Your marketing person needs guidance.** Maybe you have a coordinator who excels at execution but struggles with strategy. A fractional CMO provides that strategic layer.

## What Results Can You Expect?

Industry data shows firms using fractional marketing leadership achieve [25 to 35 percent higher marketing ROI](https://www.fisher-marketing.com/post/fisher-marketing-expands-fractional-cmo-services-in-2026) within 12 months. They also see [48 percent faster time-to-market](https://www.fisher-marketing.com/post/fisher-marketing-expands-fractional-cmo-services-in-2026) for new services and campaigns.

The improvements come from several sources:

**Eliminating waste:** Most firms waste 40 to 60 percent of their marketing budget on underperforming channels. A CMO identifies and redirects that waste.

**Improving coordination:** When vendors align and work toward common goals, efficiency improves dramatically.

**Better tracking:** When you measure what matters, you make better decisions. Better decisions produce better results.

**Strategic focus:** Random tactics produce random results. Strategy produces predictable growth.

Results take time. Expect foundation work in months one and two. Initial improvements appear in months three to four. Meaningful ROI improvement typically takes six to twelve months.

## Is a Fractional CMO Right for Your Law Firm?

**A fractional CMO is right for you if:**

- Your firm generates $1 million to $20 million in annual revenue
- You spend at least $5,000 per month on marketing
- You lack clarity on marketing ROI
- Your vendors operate without strategic oversight
- You're committed to growth

**A fractional CMO is not right for you if:**

- You're not willing to invest in marketing
- You want someone to execute tasks rather than set strategy
- You're not open to changing how you do things
- You expect overnight results

The firms that succeed share a common trait: they're committed to growth and willing to trust expert guidance while holding that expert accountable for results.

## How to Find the Right Fractional CMO

Look for these qualities when evaluating candidates.

**Legal marketing experience:** General marketing expertise isn't enough. Legal marketing has unique constraints, ethical rules, and competitive dynamics. Ask how many law firms they've worked with.

**Proven results:** Request case studies with specific metrics. Vague claims about "increased awareness" don't count. You want to see cost per case reductions, revenue growth, and ROI improvement.

**Strategic thinking:** Tactics are easy. Strategy is hard. Your CMO should think at the strategic level and be able to explain their decision-making framework.

**Communication style:** You need someone who can communicate clearly with lawyers, push back when necessary, and explain marketing concepts without jargon.

## The Bottom Line

A fractional CMO provides executive marketing leadership at a fraction of full-time cost. You get strategy, accountability, and results without the $300,000 or more annual investment of a full-time hire.

For law firms between $1 million and $20 million in revenue, this model often provides the best balance of expertise and economics. You get the strategic brain that drives growth without the overhead that strains your budget.

The firms that grow predictably have marketing leadership. The firms that struggle have marketing tactics without strategy.
