# Fractional CMO for Law Firms: The Complete Guide

Every law firm that invests in marketing needs marketing leadership. The question is what form that leadership takes.

For most firms between $1 million and $20 million in revenue, a fractional CMO provides the best balance of expertise and economics. You get strategic leadership without the overhead of a full-time executive.

This guide covers everything you need to know: what a fractional CMO does, when to hire one, what it costs, and how to find the right fit for your firm.

## What Is a Fractional CMO?

A fractional CMO is a senior marketing executive who works with your law firm on a part-time or contract basis. The term "fractional" means you're getting a fraction of their time, not a fraction of their expertise.

These executives typically have 15 to 25 years of marketing leadership experience. They've held CMO or VP of Marketing roles at companies ranging from startups to large corporations. Many have worked specifically in legal services marketing.

The typical arrangement involves 10 to 40 hours per month. That's enough time for strategy development, vendor oversight, and ongoing guidance. It's not enough to justify a full-time salary of $200,000 or more.

For law firms, this model addresses a fundamental mismatch. You need executive-level marketing thinking, but you don't have executive-level marketing budgets. A fractional arrangement solves that problem.

For a quick overview of the role, see our answer page on what is a fractional CMO.

### How Fractional Differs from Full-Time

A full-time CMO sits in your office every day. They attend every meeting. They manage every project. They become deeply embedded in your organization.

A fractional CMO operates differently. They focus on high-impact activities: strategy, decision-making, vendor management, and performance tracking. They're not there to do the daily work. They're there to make sure the daily work gets done correctly.

Think of it this way: a full-time CMO is an employee. A fractional CMO is a strategic partner with skin in the game.

### How Fractional Differs from Agencies

Marketing agencies execute tactics. They run your Google Ads. They optimize your SEO. They build your website. They produce your content.

What agencies don't do is set strategy. They don't tell you which channels deserve your budget. They don't hold other vendors accountable. They don't connect marketing activities to business outcomes.

That's the gap a fractional CMO fills. They sit above the agencies, coordinating their efforts and measuring their results. When an agency underperforms, the CMO catches it and fixes it. When an agency excels, the CMO doubles down.

Learn more about why marketing agencies fail law firms and what you can do about it.

## Why Law Firms Need a Fractional CMO

Marketing has become more complex. The days of running a Yellow Pages ad and waiting for the phone to ring are over. Today's law firm marketing involves multiple channels, multiple vendors, sophisticated tracking systems, and constant optimization.

Most law firm partners don't have time to manage all of this. They're busy practicing law. So marketing gets delegated to whoever's available: an office manager, a junior associate, or an outside agency with no real oversight.

The result? Marketing that lacks direction. Vendors who aren't accountable. Money spent without clear returns. Growth that feels random instead of predictable.

### The Coordination Problem

Here's what typically happens as law firms grow.

A firm hires an SEO agency. Then a PPC manager. Then a website developer. Maybe a content writer. Perhaps a social media person.

Each vendor does their job. They send reports. They show activity. They bill monthly.

But nobody asks the hard questions. Is this working? What's our actual cost per case? Are these vendors aligned? Should we double down or pull back?

According to industry data, law firms using fractional marketing leadership achieve [25 to 35% higher marketing ROI](https://www.fisher-marketing.com/post/fisher-marketing-expands-fractional-cmo-services-in-2026) within 12 months. The improvement comes not from spending more, but from spending smarter.

### The Expertise Gap

Most law firm administrators lack deep marketing expertise. They can manage vendors and track budgets, but they struggle with strategy. They don't know which marketing channels work best for different practice areas. They don't understand how to measure true ROI. They can't evaluate whether an agency is doing good work or just staying busy.

A fractional CMO brings that expertise. They've seen what works across dozens or hundreds of firms. They know which vendors deliver and which ones coast. They understand the unique challenges of legal marketing: ethical constraints, high-value clients, long sales cycles, and intense competition.

### The Budget Reality

Here's the math that makes fractional CMOs compelling.

A full-time marketing director in a major legal market earns [$240,000 to $350,000 per year](https://www.ambitionsearch.com/blog/2024/08/legal-marketing-bd-and-communications-salary-guide-washington-dc/). Add benefits, bonuses, and overhead, and you're looking at $300,000 to $450,000 in total cost.

A fractional CMO costs $5,000 to $15,000 per month, which translates to $60,000 to $180,000 per year. That's [50 to 80% savings](https://www.fisher-marketing.com/post/fisher-marketing-expands-fractional-cmo-services-in-2026) on executive costs.

For a firm under $10 million in revenue, the math is clear. You can afford strategic marketing leadership. You just can't afford it full-time.

## What a Fractional CMO Actually Does

A fractional CMO wears several hats. Here's what the role looks like in practice.

### Strategic Planning

Every firm needs a marketing strategy. Not tactics. Strategy.

A CMO answers fundamental questions:

- Who are your ideal clients?
- What makes you different from competitors?
- Which practice areas should you prioritize?
- What's your budget and how should it be allocated?
- What does success look like and how do we measure it?

Without answers to these questions, you're doing random marketing activities and hoping something works. That's expensive.

A good fractional CMO spends the first 30 to 60 days developing a comprehensive marketing strategy. This becomes the roadmap that guides all future decisions. For guidance on building your law firm marketing budget, check our dedicated guide.

### Vendor Management

Most law firms work with multiple marketing vendors: SEO agency, PPC manager, website developer, content writer, social media manager, and others.

Who coordinates them? Who ensures they're aligned? Who checks their work?

That's the CMO's job. They run the team meeting. They review the reports. They ask the hard questions. They ensure everyone rows in the same direction.

When vendors know someone who understands their work watches them, performance improves. When vendors know they can hide behind jargon and vanity metrics, performance suffers.

### Performance Tracking

How do you know if marketing is working? Not vanity metrics like impressions or clicks. Real metrics that connect to revenue.

A fractional CMO implements tracking systems that measure:

- Cost per lead by channel
- Cost per consultation by channel
- Cost per signed case by channel
- Marketing ROI by channel and overall
- Lead quality scores
- Conversion rates at each stage

With this data, decision-making becomes straightforward. Spend more on channels that work. Spend less on channels that don't. Stop guessing.

### Team Development

Maybe you have marketing staff. Maybe they're tactically competent but strategically lost. Maybe they need guidance and mentorship.

A fractional CMO develops your internal team. They train staff on best practices. They give them frameworks for decision-making. They help them level up their skills.

When the engagement eventually ends, your team is stronger than when it started. That's the goal.

### Executive Partnership

Marketing decisions intersect with business decisions. Pricing. Positioning. Practice area development. Growth planning. Geographic expansion.

A fractional CMO participates in these conversations at the executive level. They bring the marketing perspective to leadership discussions. They translate business goals into marketing plans and marketing results back into business outcomes.

Explore the top benefits of fractional CMO services for law firm owners.

## When to Hire a Fractional CMO

This model works best in specific situations. Here's how to know if the timing is right for your firm.

### You're Spending Money But Not Seeing Results

If your marketing budget exceeds $5,000 per month and you can't clearly tie spending to signed cases, you need oversight. Someone needs to implement tracking, analyze the data, and hold vendors accountable.

The research shows that [54% of legal marketing decision-makers](https://www.digitalauthority.me/resources/fractional-law-firm-cmo-growth-strategies/) have increased their budgets recently. But increased spending without increased oversight just means increased waste.

### You Have Vendors But No Strategy

Multiple agencies doing their own things isn't a strategy. It's chaos. Each vendor optimizes for their own metrics. The SEO agency celebrates rankings. The PPC team brags about clicks. Nobody focuses on what matters: signed clients.

You need someone to set direction, coordinate efforts, and measure what actually matters.

### You're Ready to Scale But Don't Know How

Growth requires planning. If you want to add attorneys, open new offices, or expand into new practice areas, you need a marketing roadmap. What channels will support that growth? What budget does it require? What timeline is realistic?

A fractional CMO builds that roadmap and helps you execute it.

### You Can't Justify a Full-Time Hire

Until your firm reaches significant scale, a full-time CMO salary doesn't make sense. For firms under $10 million in revenue, the fractional model provides executive expertise at a manageable cost.

As one industry analysis notes, firms should consider [scaling from fractional to full-time when revenue exceeds $10 million or marketing spend surpasses $500,000 annually](https://www.fisher-marketing.com/post/fisher-marketing-expands-fractional-cmo-services-in-2026).

### Your Current Marketing Person Needs Direction

Maybe you have a marketing coordinator who excels at execution but struggles with strategy. They need a CMO to guide them, not to replace them.

A fractional CMO provides that strategic layer. They give your coordinator direction, accountability, and professional development. Your coordinator becomes more valuable. Your marketing becomes more effective.

## What It Costs

Fractional CMO services typically range from $5,000 to $15,000 per month depending on several factors.

### Monthly Retainer Model

Most fractional CMOs work on monthly retainer. You pay a fixed fee for a defined scope of work and time commitment. Common arrangements include:

**Light engagement ($5,000 to $7,000 per month):** Strategic guidance, monthly strategy sessions, performance review, vendor oversight. Typically 10 to 15 hours per month.

**Standard engagement ($8,000 to $12,000 per month):** Comprehensive strategy, weekly check-ins, hands-on vendor management, team development. Typically 15 to 25 hours per month.

**Intensive engagement ($12,000 to $15,000 per month):** Deep involvement, multiple weekly touchpoints, project management, significant hands-on work. Typically 25 to 40 hours per month.

### Full-Time CMO Comparison

Here's how fractional costs compare to full-time:

| Cost Category | Full-Time CMO | Fractional CMO |
|---------------|---------------|----------------|
| Annual salary | $200,000 to $350,000 | N/A |
| Benefits (20 to 30%) | $40,000 to $105,000 | N/A |
| Bonuses (10 to 20%) | $20,000 to $70,000 | N/A |
| Overhead | $15,000 to $30,000 | N/A |
| Recruiting costs | $30,000 to $70,000 | N/A |
| Monthly retainer | N/A | $5,000 to $15,000 |
| **Total annual cost** | **$305,000 to $625,000** | **$60,000 to $180,000** |

For most firms, the fractional model costs 50 to 80% less than full-time while delivering similar strategic value.

### ROI Expectations

What return should you expect from this investment?

Industry data shows firms using fractional CMO leadership see [25 to 35% higher marketing ROI](https://www.fisher-marketing.com/post/fisher-marketing-expands-fractional-cmo-services-in-2026) within 12 months. They also achieve [48% faster time-to-market](https://www.fisher-marketing.com/post/fisher-marketing-expands-fractional-cmo-services-in-2026) for new services and campaigns.

The savings often come from cutting ineffective marketing spend. When someone actually analyzes where your money goes, they typically find significant waste. Redirecting that waste to effective channels improves results without increasing budget.

## How a Fractional CMO Engagement Works

A typical engagement follows a structured process. Here's what to expect.

### Month 1: Discovery and Audit

The first month focuses on understanding your business and current marketing situation.

**Week 1 to 2: Discovery**

The CMO meets with partners and key stakeholders to understand firm history, goals, and constraints. They review current marketing materials and messaging. They document ideal client profiles and case types. They assess your competitive market.

**Week 3 to 4: Audit**

The CMO reviews all marketing spend and contracts. They analyze campaign performance data. They interview vendors and internal staff. They identify tracking gaps and measurement issues. They document findings and opportunities.

By month's end, the CMO has a clear picture of where you are and what needs to change.

### Month 2 to 3: Strategy Development

With the audit complete, strategy development begins.

**Strategy Components:**

- Target client definition and segmentation
- Positioning and messaging framework
- Channel strategy and budget allocation
- Vendor evaluation and recommendations
- KPIs and measurement plan
- 12-month roadmap with quarterly milestones

This strategy becomes the foundation for everything that follows. Every marketing decision filters through it.

### Month 4 and Beyond: Execution and Optimization

With strategy set, the focus shifts to execution and ongoing improvement.

**Ongoing Activities:**

- Weekly or biweekly strategy sessions
- Vendor coordination and management
- Performance tracking and reporting
- Campaign optimization
- Team training and development
- Quarterly strategy reviews and adjustments

The CMO doesn't do the daily work. They make sure the daily work gets done correctly and moves toward strategic goals.

### Typical Timeline to Results

Marketing takes time. Set realistic expectations:

**Month 1 to 2:** Foundation work. Tracking setup. Strategy development. Little visible impact yet.

**Month 3 to 4:** Initial changes implemented. Early data starts flowing. Some quick wins possible.

**Month 5 to 6:** Meaningful improvements visible. Cost per lead decreasing. Lead quality improving.

**Month 7 to 12:** Compound effects kick in. ROI clearly positive. Systems running smoothly.

Firms that expect overnight results get disappointed. Firms that commit to the process get transformed.

## What to Look for in a Fractional CMO

Not all fractional CMOs are equal. Here's how to evaluate candidates.

### Legal Marketing Experience

General marketing expertise isn't enough. Legal marketing has unique constraints, channels, and competitive dynamics.

Look for someone who understands:

- Bar advertising rules and ethical constraints
- The psychology of legal consumers under stress
- High-value, low-volume client acquisition
- Practice-area-specific marketing approaches
- The unique competitive dynamics in legal services

Ask candidates how many law firms they've worked with and what results they achieved. Experience matters.

### Proven Results

Ask for case studies. What results have they achieved for firms like yours? Can they demonstrate actual impact?

**Warning signs:**

- Can't provide specific metrics
- Results seem vague or unmeasurable
- No references from legal clients
- Focuses on activities rather than outcomes

**Good signs:**

- Clear before-and-after metrics
- References who will speak enthusiastically
- Specific examples relevant to your situation
- Track record of measurable improvement

### Strategic Thinking

Tactics are easy. Strategy is hard. Your CMO should think at the strategic level, not just execute tasks.

During interviews, ask:

- "How would you approach developing a marketing strategy for our firm?"
- "What questions would you need answered before making recommendations?"
- "Describe a situation where you changed a firm's strategic direction and why."

Listen for structured thinking, probing questions, and a willingness to challenge assumptions.

### Communication Style

You need someone who can communicate with lawyers. That means no jargon, clear explanations, and the ability to push back when necessary.

Watch for:

- Do they explain marketing concepts clearly?
- Do they ask good questions about your business?
- Do they seem comfortable disagreeing with you?
- Is their communication style compatible with your firm culture?

### Cultural Fit

You'll work closely with this person. Do they understand your firm's values? Do they communicate in a way that works for you? Do your personalities mesh?

Chemistry matters in any partnership. Trust your instincts.

## The Fractional CMO Engagement Model

Different CMOs structure their engagements differently. Here are the common models.

### Retainer-Based

Most common. You pay a fixed monthly fee for a defined scope of work. Benefits include predictable costs and guaranteed availability.

### Project-Based

Some CMOs work on specific projects: strategy development, marketing audit, vendor selection. Benefits include defined scope and clear deliverables. Downside is lack of ongoing oversight.

### Hybrid

Combine project work with ongoing retainer. Start with a strategy project, then transition to monthly oversight. This often works well for firms new to fractional CMO services.

### Performance-Based Elements

Some CMOs include performance-based compensation. A portion of their fee ties to achieving specific metrics. This aligns incentives but requires solid tracking systems that measure cost per lead, cost per case, and conversion rates.

## Common Objections and Responses

When I suggest fractional CMO services to law firm partners, I hear the same objections repeatedly. Here's how to think about them.

### "We Already Have a Marketing Agency"

Agencies execute tactics. They don't set strategy. Having an SEO agency doesn't mean you have marketing leadership any more than having a paralegal means you have legal strategy.

A fractional CMO manages your agency. They make sure the agency works toward your goals, not just their own metrics. They catch underperformance and demand accountability.

Most firms that add a fractional CMO keep their existing agencies. The CMO makes those agencies more effective.

### "Our Office Manager Handles Marketing"

With respect to office managers, marketing leadership requires dedicated expertise. Would you have your office manager handle complex litigation?

Office managers can coordinate activities and track budgets. They rarely have the strategic expertise to make the decisions that increase case volume and reduce cost per case.

A fractional CMO works with your office manager. They provide the strategy layer. Your office manager handles execution and administration. Both roles become more effective.

### "We Can't Afford It"

Can you afford to waste $50,000 per year on marketing that doesn't work? The cost of not having leadership often exceeds the cost of getting it.

Calculate your current marketing spend. Estimate how much of it might be wasted (industry average is 40 to 60%). Compare that waste to the cost of a fractional CMO.

For most firms, the fractional CMO pays for itself within months by eliminating waste and improving efficiency.

### "We're Not Big Enough Yet"

If you're spending money on marketing, you're big enough to need strategy. Even $5,000 per month is $60,000 per year. That investment deserves thoughtful management.

The question isn't whether you're big enough for marketing leadership. The question is whether you're big enough to justify full-time marketing leadership. If you're not, fractional is your answer.

### "We Tried Working with a Consultant Before and It Didn't Work"

What went wrong? Many "consultants" are actually just agencies with a different name. Others lack the depth of experience to drive real change.

A true fractional CMO is different. They're not selling you services. They're providing executive leadership. They're accountable for results, not just activities.

Before dismissing the model, understand why your previous experience failed. Then look for a fractional CMO who addresses those specific issues.

## How to Hire a Fractional CMO

Ready to move forward? Here's a practical process.

### Step 1: Define Your Needs

Before talking to candidates, clarify what you need:

- What's your current marketing situation?
- What problems do you need solved?
- What does success look like?
- What's your budget range?
- What level of involvement do you need?

The clearer your requirements, the better your candidate evaluation.

### Step 2: Source Candidates

Where to find fractional CMOs:

- **Referrals:** Ask other law firm owners who they work with
- **Industry associations:** Legal Marketing Association, state bar events
- **LinkedIn search:** "Fractional CMO" + "law firm" or "legal"
- **Specialized firms:** Companies that provide fractional executive services

Aim to speak with three to five candidates before deciding.

### Step 3: Evaluate Candidates

For each candidate, assess:

- Legal marketing experience and results
- Strategic thinking ability
- Communication style and cultural fit
- Availability and engagement model
- References from similar clients

Don't rush this process. A bad hire costs more than taking extra time to find the right fit.

### Step 4: Structure the Engagement

Once you select a candidate, structure the engagement clearly:

- Scope of work and deliverables
- Time commitment and availability
- Fee structure and payment terms
- Success metrics and review process
- Termination provisions

Put it in writing. Both parties should understand expectations clearly.

### Step 5: Set Up for Success

Give your new CMO what they need:

- Access to all marketing data and systems
- Introduction to vendors and staff
- Time with partners to understand firm goals
- Authority to make decisions within defined boundaries
- Regular check-in schedule

The more support you provide, the faster they'll deliver results.

## Case Studies: Fractional CMO Success

Here are examples of what fractional CMO leadership can achieve.

### Personal Injury Firm: From Chaos to System

**Situation:** A personal injury firm spending $25,000 per month on marketing. Cases coming in but no idea which channels produced them. Cost per case unknown. Marketing felt like a black hole.

**Intervention:** Fractional CMO implemented tracking systems across all channels. Discovered half the budget went to channels producing almost nothing. The other half went to channels performing well.

**Results over 6 months:**

- Reallocated budget from underperformers to performers
- Cost per case decreased 40%
- Case volume doubled with same budget
- Partners gained visibility into marketing ROI

### Family Law Firm: Strategic Repositioning

**Situation:** A family law firm competing on price in a crowded market. High lead volume but low case quality. Staff overwhelmed handling unqualified inquiries.

**Intervention:** Fractional CMO repositioned firm as high-service option for complex cases. Changed messaging, updated website, revised targeting criteria. Trained intake on qualifying leads.

**Results over 12 months:**

- Lead volume decreased 30%
- Case quality improved dramatically
- Average case value increased 60%
- Total revenue increased 40% with less stress

### Immigration Practice: Scaling Thoughtfully

**Situation:** A solo immigration attorney ready to add associates and grow. Marketing had been word-of-mouth only. No infrastructure for scaling.

**Intervention:** Fractional CMO built marketing foundation: strategy, website, content program, paid advertising, referral system. Created processes for handling increased lead flow.

**Results over 18 months:**

- Revenue grew from $500,000 to $1.2 million
- Added two attorneys to handle volume
- Cost per case established at $180
- Predictable lead flow enabled confident hiring

## Integrating a Fractional CMO with Your Team

Success requires thoughtful integration. Here's how to make it work.

### Define Roles Clearly

Who does what? Clarify responsibilities for:

- **Fractional CMO:** Strategy, vendor management, performance oversight, executive partnership
- **Internal marketing staff:** Execution, coordination, vendor communication, daily operations
- **Partners:** Goal setting, budget approval, major decisions
- **Vendors:** Specific deliverables within their expertise

When roles are clear, accountability follows.

### Establish Communication Rhythms

Regular communication keeps everyone aligned:

- **Weekly:** Quick check-in with marketing staff (15 to 30 minutes)
- **Biweekly or monthly:** Strategy session with partners (60 to 90 minutes)
- **Monthly:** Vendor review meetings (30 to 60 minutes each)
- **Quarterly:** Strategic review and planning (2 to 4 hours)

Adjust frequency based on your needs and the engagement level.

### Create Feedback Loops

The CMO needs information to do their job:

- Access to all marketing data and reporting
- Feedback from intake on lead quality
- Input from attorneys on case quality
- Financial data on case values and profitability

The more visibility they have, the better decisions they make.

### Give Authority Appropriate to Responsibility

Don't hire a CMO and then second-guess every decision. If you don't trust their judgment, you hired the wrong person.

Define boundaries clearly. Within those boundaries, let them lead. Hold them accountable for results, not for doing things your way.

## The Connection Between Marketing and Intake

Your marketing is only as good as your intake process. This deserves special attention.

You can generate 100 perfect leads, but if your intake process is broken, you'll convert 5% of them. Another firm generates 50 leads with a great intake process and converts 30% of them. Same cost per lead, vastly different outcomes.

### What a CMO Does with Intake

A fractional CMO doesn't just optimize marketing. They optimize the connection between marketing and intake.

**Assessment:** How quickly does intake respond to leads? What's the conversion rate by source? Where do leads drop off?

**Improvement:** Train intake staff on handling leads from different channels. Implement follow-up sequences. Create scripts and processes.

**Measurement:** Track conversion rates by source. Identify which marketing channels produce leads that intake converts well.

Marketing and intake should operate as one system. The best marketing improvement might not be a new campaign. It might be fixing intake.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How many hours per month does a fractional CMO typically work?

Most engagements range from 10 to 40 hours per month. Light engagements (strategic guidance and oversight) run 10 to 15 hours. Standard engagements (comprehensive management) run 15 to 25 hours. Intensive engagements (heavy hands-on involvement) run 25 to 40 hours.

### How quickly will I see results?

Expect foundation work (tracking, strategy) in months one and two. Initial improvements typically appear in months three to four. Meaningful ROI improvement usually takes six to twelve months. Marketing is a marathon, not a sprint.

### Can a fractional CMO work with my existing agencies?

Yes, this is common. The CMO provides the oversight and strategic direction your agencies need. Most firms keep existing vendors and see those vendors perform better under proper management.

### What if I'm not satisfied?

Most fractional CMO engagements include termination provisions, often 30 to 60 days notice. Unlike hiring an employee, you're not locked in. This protects both parties and ensures the relationship continues only if it's working.

### How do I know if I need a fractional CMO versus a marketing coordinator?

If your primary need is someone to execute tasks (post social media, coordinate vendors, update website), you need a coordinator. If your primary need is someone to set direction, make strategic decisions, and produce measurable improvement in marketing ROI, you need a CMO. Many firms need both: a CMO for strategy and a coordinator for execution.

### Should I hire a fractional CMO or an agency?

These serve different functions. Agencies execute specific tactics (SEO, PPC, content). A CMO provides strategic leadership and oversight. Most firms benefit from having both: an agency for execution and a CMO to ensure that execution drives results.

### What happens when we outgrow fractional CMO services?

When your firm reaches sufficient scale (typically $10 million or more in revenue, or $500,000 or more in marketing spend), you may benefit from a full-time CMO. A good fractional CMO helps you make this transition, potentially helping hire and onboard your full-time leader.

### Do I need to be in the same city as my fractional CMO?

No. Most fractional CMO relationships work well remotely. Regular video calls, shared dashboards, and occasional in-person visits (if needed) make geographic distance irrelevant. Focus on finding the right fit, not the closest one.

### What industries do fractional CMOs typically come from?

The best fractional CMOs for law firms come from legal marketing backgrounds or adjacent professional services (accounting, consulting, financial services). Avoid generalists who lack experience with high-consideration, trust-based services.

## Taking the Next Step

If you've read this far, you're likely considering whether a fractional CMO makes sense for your firm.

Here's my honest assessment. A fractional CMO is right for you if:

- Your firm generates $1 million to $20 million in annual revenue
- You spend at least $5,000 per month on marketing
- You lack clarity on marketing ROI
- Your vendors operate without strategic oversight
- You're ready to grow but unsure how

A fractional CMO is not right for you if:

- You're not willing to invest in proper marketing
- You want someone to execute tasks, not set strategy
- You're not open to changing how you do things
- You expect overnight results

The firms that succeed with fractional CMO services share a common trait. They're committed to growth and willing to do what it takes to achieve it. They trust their CMO's expertise while holding them accountable for results.
