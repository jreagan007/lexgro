**Re:** Organizing Our Tools Into Client-Ready Product Offerings

## Summary

Over the past year, we've built a significant amount of marketing intelligence software for internal use. We've now organized these tools into a cohesive product suite called **LEXXLY** that can be:

1. Used internally to deliver better client results
2. Sold as standalone white-label services
3. Bundled with Fractional CMO engagements as value-adds

## The LEXXLY Suite

| Product | What It Does | Built From |
|---------|--------------|------------|
| **LexxlyIQ** | Attribution & media contribution analysis | Custom attribution modeling, GA4 integration |
| **LexxlyRank** | SEO intelligence & keyword gap analysis | DataForSEO SERP/Keywords/Backlinks APIs |
| **LexxlyPulse** | Sentiment analysis & pain point discovery | Reddit API, Reviews API, Content Analysis |
| **LexxlySchema** | Automated structured data generation | On-Page API, schema validators |
| **LexxlyBuild** | Programmatic SEO & page generation | Content Generation API, templating system |
| **LexxlyAIO** | AI search optimization & LLM mentions | DataForSEO AI Optimization API *(NEW)* |

---

## What's New: LexxlyAIO

AI search (ChatGPT, Google AI Overview) is changing how clients find lawyers. LexxlyAIO tracks:

- When/how firms get mentioned in AI responses
- Which competitors AI recommends
- What sources AI cites
- Query patterns that trigger mentions

This is a differentiator. Most agencies aren't tracking this yet.
