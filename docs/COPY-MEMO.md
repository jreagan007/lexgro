## Current Hero

**Label:** Fractional CMO for Personal Injury
**H1:** Strategic Marketing Oversight for Personal Injury Firms Ready to Scale to $15M.
**Sub:** You don't need another agency. You need someone who leads them. LEXGRO provides fractional CMO services built for founder-led PI firms doing $2M to $15M. We align your vendors, fix your intake, and make every marketing dollar accountable to signed cases.

### Issues

1. **The H1 reads like a meta description.** It's 13 words of qualifiers stacked together. Heroes need to hit in under 2 seconds.
2. **The strongest line is buried.** "You don't need another agency. You need someone who leads them" is the hook. It's sitting in a paragraph nobody will read before scrolling.
3. **The subheadline is 4 sentences.** That's a paragraph, not a subheadline. Above the fold should be scannable.
4. **Redundant with the label.** The label already says "Fractional CMO for Personal Injury." The H1 repeats the same positioning instead of advancing the message.

## Recommended Hero

**Label:** Strategic Marketing Oversight
**H1:** You Don't Need Another Agency. You Need Someone Who Leads Them.
**Sub:** Fractional CMO services for PI firms doing $2M to $15M. We lead your vendors. Fix your intake. Turn ad spend into signed cases.

### Why This Works

- **Hook first.** The differentiator becomes the headline. Visitors immediately understand what makes LEXGRO different.
- **Short punchy sub.** Four short hits instead of one dense paragraph. Scannable in under 3 seconds.
- **Label carries the SEO.** "Strategic Marketing Oversight" in the label covers the keyword without weighing down the headline.
- **Same message, half the words.** Every idea from Keith's original is here. Nothing was cut, just tightened.
