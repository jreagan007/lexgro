# LEXGRO Copywriting Guide

## Voice & Tone

LEXGRO's voice is that of a **trusted partner**, not a vendor. We speak like a knowledgeable friend who happens to be an expert in law firm marketing.

### Core Voice Attributes

1. **Conversational** - Write like you talk. Read it out loud. If it sounds stiff, rewrite it.
2. **Confident** - We know what works. No hedging or corporate speak.
3. **Direct** - Get to the point. Respect the reader's time.
4. **Warm** - We genuinely care about helping law firms grow.

## Writing Rules

### Avoid Em Dashes (—)

Em dashes feel robotic and AI-generated. They create an unnatural reading rhythm.

**Don't write:**
- "We don't just advise—we help you execute"
- "Strategic leadership—without the full-time cost"
- "Real results—not just reports"

**Write instead:**
- "We don't just advise. We help you execute."
- "Strategic leadership without the full-time cost."
- "Real results, not just reports."

Use periods for emphasis. Use commas for flow. Skip the dashes.

### Punctuation That Works

| Instead of | Use |
|------------|-----|
| Em dash (—) | Period or comma |
| Semicolons (;) | Two sentences |
| Ellipsis (...) | Nothing (just end the sentence) |

### Sentence Structure

- **Short sentences hit harder.** Use them for key points.
- Mix short and medium sentences for rhythm.
- Avoid long, complex sentences with multiple clauses.

## Headlines

### Hero Headlines

- Lead with benefit, not feature
- Use "Your" to make it personal
- Keep it under 8 words when possible

**Good:**
- "Your Growth Partner, Not Just a Vendor"
- "Predictable Revenue Starts Here"
- "Marketing Leadership Without the Overhead"

**Avoid:**
- "Comprehensive Fractional CMO Services for Law Firms"
- "We Provide Strategic Marketing Solutions"

### Section Headlines

- Use action verbs
- Be specific about the outcome
- Questions work well for engagement

**Good:**
- "How It Works"
- "Real Results for Real Law Firms"
- "Not Sure Which Service Is Right?"

## Body Copy

### Opening Lines

Start with the reader, not with us.

**Don't write:**
- "LEXGRO provides fractional CMO services..."
- "Our team of experts..."

**Write instead:**
- "Your firm deserves marketing that actually works."
- "Growing a law firm is hard enough without wasting money on marketing that doesn't convert."

### CTAs (Calls to Action)

- Use first person: "Get My Free Audit" not "Get Your Free Audit"
- Or use direct second person: "Get Your Free Growth Audit"
- Be specific about what they get
- Remove friction words like "Submit" or "Request"

**Good CTAs:**
- "Get Your Free Growth Audit"
- "Schedule a Strategy Call"
- "See the Results"

**Avoid:**
- "Submit"
- "Learn More" (when you can be more specific)
- "Contact Us"

## Words to Use

| Use | Instead of |
|-----|------------|
| Partner | Vendor, Provider |
| Growth | Success (too vague) |
| Revenue | Results (when talking money) |
| Works | Solutions |
| Help | Assist, Enable |
| Get | Receive, Obtain |

## Words to Avoid

- **Leverage** - Just say "use"
- **Utilize** - Just say "use"
- **Solutions** - Be specific about what it is
- **Synergy** - No
- **Best-in-class** - Everyone says this
- **Cutting-edge** - Overused
- **Robust** - Meaningless
- **Seamless** - Show, don't tell

## Formatting

### Lists

Use bullets sparingly. When you do:
- Keep items parallel in structure
- Start each with an action verb or noun
- Don't end items with periods unless they're full sentences

### Numbers

- Use numerals for stats: "200+ law firms" not "two hundred"
- Use words for small numbers in prose: "three key benefits"
- Always use numerals for money: "$47M+" not "forty-seven million"

### Capitalization

- Headline case for headers: "Your Path to Predictable Growth"
- Sentence case for body copy
- Don't capitalize common terms: "fractional CMO" not "Fractional CMO" (unless starting a sentence)

## Brand-Specific Terms

| Term | Usage |
|------|-------|
| LEXGRO | Always all caps |
| Fractional CMO | Lowercase unless starting sentence |
| Keith Dyer | Full name on first mention, "Keith" after |
| Growth Audit | Capitalize when referring to our specific service |

## Examples

### Before & After

## Quick Checklist

Before publishing any copy, ask:

- [ ] Would I say this out loud to a friend?
- [ ] Did I avoid em dashes?
- [ ] Is the first sentence about the reader, not us?
- [ ] Can I cut any words without losing meaning?
- [ ] Does it sound like a partner, not a salesperson?
