## MESSAGE 3: Intelligence Architecture

```
🧠 *Our Proprietary Stack*

Four-layer architecture:

*Gather* → Web intelligence engine (parallel scraping, competitor mapping)
*Research* → Citation-backed fact-finding, real-time data
*Synthesize* → News monitoring, scoring, trend detection
*Create* → Content engine with voice matching + style enforcement

Key capability: We can execute thousands of intelligence queries simultaneously. What takes competitors hours takes us minutes.

Each layer is purpose-built. No single system tries to do everything.

*Process:*
1. Proprietary social listening across forums and communities

*Sales Point:* "Our FAQs answer questions people actually ask, not questions we guess."
```

## MESSAGE 10: CTV + Behavioral Targeting

```
📺 *Capability: CTV Advertising + Behavioral Audiences*

This is the Taqtics advantage. Competitors cannot replicate this.

*The Problem with Traditional PI Advertising:*
You wait for someone to search "car accident lawyer." By then, they're comparing 10 firms.

*Our Approach:*
We reach households with qualifying injury events BEFORE they search.

*Behavioral Audiences:*
• Qualifying injury event signals at household level
• Life event triggers (accidents, medical events, workplace incidents)
• Intent data from real-world behavior
• 95 percent household matching rate

*This is 90 percent blue ocean.* First to establish trust, first call when ready.

*Platform Coverage:*
• 150+ premium streaming networks
• HBO Max, Hulu, Peacock, Paramount+, YouTube TV
• Non-skippable, 100 percent completion ads
• Where 48 percent of viewers now watch

*Market Exclusivity:*
One firm per market. Period. Competitors cannot access the same behavioral audiences in your geography.

*Attribution:*
Commercial → website → call → signed case tracking
CallRail, GA4, Dial800 integration

*Sales Point:* "Your competitors fight over the 10 percent who Google 'car accident lawyer.' We're talking to the 90 percent who haven't searched yet."
```

## MESSAGE 11: Google Discover

```
🚀 *Capability: Google Discover Optimization*

*Typical Agency:* Hope content gets picked up
*Us:* Systematic content types that trigger Discover

*Content types that perform:*
• Celebrity/Notable : public figures, prominent names
• Human Interest : survivor stories, personal journeys
• Breaking Verdict : legal outcomes, settlements
• Treatment Hope : new therapies, breakthroughs
• Data/Statistics : new research findings

*What makes content Discover-ready:*
• Compelling headlines (curiosity, not clickbait)
• High-quality card images (800x450, documentary style)
• Fresh content signals
• E-E-A-T signals (author bios, sources, expert review)
• Mobile-optimized (paragraphs under 5 lines)

*Story scoring includes Discover Potential as 25 percent of total score*

*Sales Point:* "We optimize for Google Discover, not just traditional search. That's a different traffic source most agencies ignore."
